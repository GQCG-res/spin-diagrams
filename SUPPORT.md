# Setup

Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and the [Remote Container Extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers). Inside VSCode, use `Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container` to either open the [paper](paper/README.md) folder (which will allow you to typeset the paper) or the [notebooks](notebooks/README.md) folder (which will allow you to run the calculations that support the paper).
